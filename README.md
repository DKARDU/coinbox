Note
Before starting this project, we must first test the address of the 20X4 I2C LCD or 16x2 I2C LCD. The character address of each LCD is different, it may be 0x27, it may be 0x3F. Only if the character address of your LCD is correct, the LCD screen will display characters. Otherwise, no characters will appear on the LCD screen.
